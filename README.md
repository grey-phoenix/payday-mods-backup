# Payday 2 Mod installation

The contents of this folder should be extracted to the `Steam/steamapps/common/Payday 2` folder
The README can be deleted after it is read.

## What is WSOCK32.dll?
It is the mod-loader. You can read more about it and download a fresh one [here](https://superblt.znix.xyz/) if you like.

## What if my game crashes?

## Will I get banned?
Almost certainly not. There have been a couple bans, but OverKill really just cares about people not paying for DLCs or crashing other people's games.
They care so little about mods/cheats that there is a checkmark in lobbies to allow modders and cheaters to join.

## Will these mods mark me as a cheater in game?
No, I've tested and confirmed that this doesn't happen with this mod. (As of June 4, 2020)

## What if my game crashes?
If it happens immediately upon booting up the game, the game has probably updated and one or more mods are now incompatible with the game.
Moving your WSOCK32.dll file into your mods folder should disable mods altogether, and if that doesn't work you could move it to your desktop or something.

Determining which mod(s) cause the issue can only really be determined with trial and error.
